# Overview

Using [CRISP-DM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-industry_standard_process_for_data_mining) and business understanding we found characteristics defining 5 clusters, with some requiring additional monitoring and early intervention for course failure. 

## Data & processing

The data comprised of multiple sources including grades, demographic, residency and enrolment information, which were cleaned and engineered based on knowledge expertise. 

## Clustering

Feature subsets were selected based on correlation analysis and analysed based on their cluster scores.
Although the data was a mix of numeric and categorical, it was accounted for with a suitable dissimilarity and clustering method.

## Reporting

Characteristics of each clusters were interpreted at a business level for the client Division.
A review of the process and future improvements were documented throughout for the following iterations. These included pipe-line streamlining, data collection and application analysis.
Also, documentation for future analyst and contributors were completed to ensure long term benefit.
